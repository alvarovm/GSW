To build all 3 codes (C, C++, Fortran), you can either just run "make" with no
arguments:

   make


Here is the Cobalt command to submit a job (shown for the C++ code):

     qsub -t 5 -n 16 --mode c1 -A ALCF_Getting_Started -q training  hello_mpi_f90

This should echo a number to the screen, which is the Cobalt job id. To see
status of your job, if the job id was 227054, say, use the following Cobalt
command:

   qstat 227054

To see status of all jobs (queued and running), use "qstat" with no
arguments. To learn more about using qstat, run

   man qsub
