To build all 3 codes (C, C++, Fortran), you can either just run "make" with no
arguments:

   make


In this example, we are going to use the Cobalt "script" mode. When you issue
the qsub command, you will give it a pathname for a script (bash, csh, or
other script type) rather than the pathname for your executable program.

Here is the Cobalt command to submit a job (shown for the C++ code):

     qsub script.sh

See the file script.sh. In there, note the use of the runjob command to
execuate your program (rather than qsub, since we're using qsub to submit the
script instead of submitting the executable directly).

As with basic qsub (non-script mode), your qsub in mode script command should
echo a number to the screen, which is the Cobalt job id.
