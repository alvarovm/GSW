MPMD Example
============

This example demonstrates how to use the BG/Q funcationality for multiple 
program, multiple data. Multiple executables can be run which share the same
MPI_COMM_WORLD.

Makefile - makefile for building executables
exe1.c - source for exe1.x
exe2.c - source for exe2.x
exe1.x - bg/q executable
exe2.x - bg/q executable  
mapfile - special mapping file used runjob
submit.sh - script to submit the job
script.sh - script executed by job which executes runjob

The example submits a job on 128 nodes with 16 ranks-per-node, or 2048 ranks
in total. exe1.x is run on ranks 0-1023 and exe2.x is run on ranks 1023-2047.

The specification for the multiple executables is handled within the mapfile.

mapfile
=======
#mpmdbegin 0-1023 <- ranks this exe will run on
#mpmdcmd exe1.x <- exe name
#mpmdend
#mpmdbegin 1024-2047
#mpmdcmd exe2.x
#mpmdend
#mapping ABCDET <- either a default mapping or specify individual rank map

source
======
The two sources are trivial and just differ by the name in the output
of standard out.

building
========
'make' will build the two binaries.

running
=======
./submit.sh
