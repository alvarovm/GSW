Compile:

  mpixlc_r -O3 -qsmp=omp -g -o hello_mpi_openmp hello.c

Here is the Cobalt command to submit a job

  qsub -t 5 -n 4 --mode c16 --env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 -A ALCF_Getting_Started -q training hello_mpi_openmp

(If you have other environment variables to set, separate them with ":",
something like --env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4:BG_THREADLAYOUT=1.) If the Cobalt job
id is 227054, you should see output like the following in 227054.output when
the run completes:
